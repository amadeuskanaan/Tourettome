#
# # Given computational resource limitations (e.g., 32 GB of physical memory), as well as a number of centers with a
# # small number of time points due to repetition times >2.0 s, each TC-GICA run was applied to a dataset consisting
# # of 18 partic- ipants/center from the 17 centers that collected a minimum of 165 functional volumes per scan. This
# # approach also ensured that a single centerâ€™s data would not drive the ICA components de- tected. Consistent with
# # recent work on low-dimensional ICA (8), the number of components was fixed at 20. Given the potential for such
# # factors as initial random values and subject sampling to affect ICA results, 25 TC-GICA analyses were performed,
# # each using a unique resampling from each of the 17 centers. A meta-ICA analysis was then carried out across the 25
# # runs to extract the 20 spatially independent components consistently identified across the 25 runs. An alternative
# # hierarchical clustering approach based on ICASSO (9) is described below. The two approaches yielded similar results.
# # Dual regression (10, 11) was then carried out using the 20 resulting components as templates, to produce individual
# # participant maps for each of the 20 components.
#
# # 1- Cut all data to smallest number of frames
# # 2- Keep only subjects with FD within 2SD
# # 3- Create 25 population lists ...
# ###### max length = length of smallest population
# ###### each population list should be half controls and half patients
# ###### use unique resample each time.
# ######
# # 4- Run melodic with n=20 components on each population list
# # 5- Run melodic on the 25 ICAs.
